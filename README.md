# Pong Game - Modernized Version

## Game Description
This is a modernized version of the classic Pong game, featuring enhanced gameplay and new features. Players can choose between three different gameplay modes: 
- **Two Player Mode**: Play against another player.
- **Weak AI Mode**: Face a less challenging AI opponent.
- **Strong AI Mode**: Take on a highly reactive and fast AI for a tougher challenge.

The game also includes features such as:
- A dynamic **pause menu**, allowing players to pause and resume the game or return to the home menu.
- **Theme switching** between light and dark modes for varied visual appeal.
- **AI-controlled paddles** that respond differently based on difficulty level, creating a unique experience for each mode.
- An enhanced **ball speed mechanism** that increases ball speed in Strong AI mode, making the game more challenging over time.

## How the Game Works
The game involves two paddles: one controlled by the player and the other by either another player or an AI opponent. The objective is simple: hit the ball back and forth and prevent it from passing your paddle. 

### Game Rules:
- **Serving**: At the start of each round, the ball is served to the opponent.
- **Scoring**: If the opponent fails to hit the ball and it passes their paddle, you score a point. The first player to reach **11 points** with at least a **2-point lead** wins the game.
- **AI Behavior**:
  - **Weak AI** moves slower and less accurately.
  - **Strong AI** tracks the ball closely and increases ball speed to make gameplay more difficult.

### Game Controls:
- **Player 1**: Use `W` and `S` to move the paddle up and down.
- **Player 2 / AI**: In Two Player mode, use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to move. In AI modes, the AI controls the paddle.
- **Pause**: Press `ESC` to pause the game, where you can choose to resume or go back to the home menu.
- **Menu Navigation**: Use arrow keys to navigate and `Enter` to select menu options.

### Key Features:
- **Pause and Resume**: Press `ESC` to bring up a pause menu and choose between "Resume" or "Home."
- **Dynamic Score Tracking**: The game tracks player scores, updating as each round progresses.
- **Enhanced UI**: The game includes a clean and simple user interface for score display and game modes.
